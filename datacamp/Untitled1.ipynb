      "      round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no\n",
      "      other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls,\n",
      "      and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not\n",
      "      properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown\n",
      "      upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman’s bag, containing the\n",
      "      harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there\n",
      "      was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\n",
      "      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\n",
      "      at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing\n",
      "      but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags\n",
      "      something like the stained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin.\n",
      "      There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as you see the same in\n",
      "      South American ponchos. But could it be possible that any sober harpooneer\n",
      "      would get into a door mat, and parade the streets of any Christian town in\n",
      "      that sort of guise? I put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a\n",

      "      though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I\n",
      "      went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw\n",
      "      such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I\n",

      "      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\n",
      "      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a\n",
      "      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half\n",
      "      undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about the\n",

      "      made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and then\n",
      "      blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care\n",
      "      of heaven.\n",

      "    \n",
      "      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery, there\n",

      "      long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly\n",
      "      made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall\n",
      "      in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\n",

      "      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n",
      "      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n",
      "      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\n",
      "      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of\n",
      "      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness\n",
      "      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in\n",
      "      unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when,\n",
      "      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,\n",
      "      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking\n",
      "      squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been\n",
      "      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But\n",
      "      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n",
      "      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n",
      "      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I\n",
      "      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred\n",
      "      to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who,\n",
      "      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that\n",
      "      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with\n",
      "      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his\n",
      "      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make\n",
      "      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\n",
      "      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it\n",
      "      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of\n",
      "      a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n",
      "      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n",
      "      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n",
      "      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n",
      "      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n",
      "      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n",
      "      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the\n",
      "      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\n",
      "      thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n",
      "      hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh\n",
      "      surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing\n",
      "      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head\n",
      "      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\n",
      "      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it\n",
      "      was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this\n",
      "      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance\n",
      "      is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded\n",
      "      about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was\n",
      "      the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night.\n",
      "      In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game enough just then to\n",
      "      address him, and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed\n",
      "      inexplicable in him.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his\n",
      "      chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with\n",
      "      the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark\n",
      "      squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’ War, and just escaped\n",
      "      from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were\n",
      "      marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of\n",
      "      young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage\n",
      "      or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in\n",
      "      this Christian country. I quaked to think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps\n",
      "      the heads of his own brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens!\n",
      "      look at that tomahawk!\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\n",
      "      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\n",
      "      he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\n",
      "      dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\n",
      "      pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a\n",
      "      hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old Congo baby.\n",
      "      Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black\n",
      "      manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that\n",
      "      it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished\n",
      "      ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed\n",
      "      it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and\n",
      "      removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image,\n",
      "      like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks\n",
      "      inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\n",
      "      appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill\n",
      "      at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes\n",
      "      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\n",
      "      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top\n",
      "      and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a\n",
      "      sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and\n",
      "      still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\n",
      "      scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\n",
      "      then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it\n",
      "      to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry\n",
      "      sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics\n",
      "      were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who\n",
      "      seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or\n",
      "      other, during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\n",
      "      At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously,\n",
      "      and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a\n",
      "      sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him\n",

      "      jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before\n",

      "      he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was\n",

      "      into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden\n",

      "      quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural\n",

      "      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown\n",
      "      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought\n",
      "      I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little\n",
      "      parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all\n",
      "      over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of\n",
      "      which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his keeping his\n",
      "      arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly\n",
      "      rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I say, looked for\n",
      "      all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly\n",

      "      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\n",
      "      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I\n",
      "      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little sweep\n",

      "      the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my mother\n",
      "      dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed, though\n",
      "      it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June, the longest day\n",
      "      in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was no help\n",
      "      for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,\n",
      "      undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a\n",

      "      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the\n",
      "      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at\n",
      "      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,\n",

      "      going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then\n",
      "      stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked him why he\n",
      "      carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and whether all whaling\n",
      "      ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in substance, he replied,\n",
      "      that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a particular\n",
      "      affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried\n",
      "      in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales. In\n",

      "      in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage\n",
      "      the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then\n",
      "      shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,” said I, “Queequeg,\n",

      "      on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast;\n",

      "      companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\n",

      "     \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\n",

      "      weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side,\n",
      "      completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow\n",
      "      whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were\n",
      "      in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed\n",
      "      madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking\n",
      "      of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into\n",
      "      splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;\n",
      "      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it\n",
      "      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this\n",
      "      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under\n",
      "      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the\n",
      "      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the\n",
      "      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that\n",
      "      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and\n",
      "      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to\n",
      "      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For\n",
      "      three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long\n",
      "      arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders\n",
      "      through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but\n",
      "      saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself\n",
      "      perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance\n",
      "      around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and\n",
      "      disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking\n",
      "      out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked\n",
      "      them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble\n",

      "      “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have\n",

      "      round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the\n",
      "      faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of\n",
      "      Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy\n",
      "      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.\n",
      "      Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan\n",
      "      on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\n",
      "      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had\n",
      "      been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun\n",
      "      entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a\n",
      "      cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again\n",
      "      against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\n",
      "    \n",

      "      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion, be\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed\n",

      "      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\n",
      "      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\n",
      "      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in\n",
      "      cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for\n",
      "      the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and common\n",
      "      sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely\n",
      "      sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained me, to see\n",
      "      him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan of his.\n",
      "      Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the spirit caves\n",

      "      is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy\n",
      "      notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I, rather\n",
      "      digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling;\n",
      "      and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by\n",

      "      expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no;\n",
      "      only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his\n",
      "      father the king, on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the\n",
      "      enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the afternoon, and all\n",
      "      cooked and eaten that very evening.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the\n",
      "      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\n",
      "      visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a\n",
      "      great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard\n",
      "      or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great\n",
      "      wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and\n",
      "      cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\n",
      "      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\n",
      "      dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his own\n",
      "      point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one third\n",
      "      understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt\n",
      "      thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than I did. He\n",
      "      looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion, as\n",

      "      fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect\n",
      "      does the whale differ from other fish. Above, LinnÃ¦us has given you those\n",

      "    \n",

      "      shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself,\n",
      "      he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy\n",

      "      it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still\n",

      "      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\n",
      "      precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,\n",
      "      knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal\n",
      "      animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but\n",

      "      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his\n",
      "      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in\n",

      "      gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with\n",
      "      mild stun’sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all\n",
      "      appearances, the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape\n",

      "      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved\n",
      "      on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you\n",
      "      think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler\n",
      "      form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like\n",

      "      unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing\n",

      "      perished. That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If\n",

      "      the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the world right in this\n",
      "      matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be\n",
      "      found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever\n",
      "      since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings\n",
      "      of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups,\n",

      "      in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\n",

      "      century, during the Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down\n",

      "      those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some\n",

      "      Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the whales,\n",
      "      like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a\n",
      "      Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round Cape Horn into\n",

      "      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass\n",
      "      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,\n",
      "      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in\n",

      "      the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them\n",
      "      is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment\n",
      "      hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we may freely go from one to the\n",

      "      here?\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\n",
      "      heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\n",
      "      mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right Whale’s sadly\n",
      "      lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head. As you behold\n",
      "      it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of\n",
      "      pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is\n",
      "      heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving\n",
      "      token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what the\n",
      "      fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”\n",
      "     \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the\n",
      "      two most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\n",
      "      the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you\n",
      "      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\n",
      "      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\n",
      "      magnitude of the head.\n",

      "    \n",
      "      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is plain\n",
      "      that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he\n",
      "      can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s eyes\n",
      "      corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how\n",
      "      it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects through your ears.\n",
      "      You would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision\n",
      "      in advance of the straight side-line of sight; and about thirty more\n",
      "      behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you, with\n",
      "      dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not be able to see him, any more\n",
      "      than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In a word, you would have\n",
      "      two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two fronts (side\n",
      "      fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man—what, indeed,\n",
      "      but his eyes?\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\n",

      "      head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes\n",
      "      in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the impressions which\n",
      "      each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore, must see one\n",
      "      distinct picture on this side, and another distinct picture on that side;\n",
      "      while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him. Man\n",
      "      may, in effect, be said to look out on the world from a sentry-box with\n",
      "      two joined sashes for his window. But with the whale, these two sashes are\n",
      "      separately inserted, making two distinct windows, but sadly impairing the\n",
      "      view. This peculiarity of the whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne\n",

      "      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is\n",
      "      involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever\n",
      "      objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience will teach him,\n",
      "      that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one\n",

      "      and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and\n",
      "      touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two objects, and\n",

      "      of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the other\n",

      "      look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head for\n",

      "      near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his\n",
      "      sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out\n",
      "      poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a\n",
      "      leg was presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be,\n",
      "      and might occasion great trouble;—he had thrust back the leg, and by\n",
      "      a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so\n",
      "      that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way—head\n",

      "      for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its\n",
      "      side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales\n",
      "      that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads\n",
      "      of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might\n",
      "      with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon\n",
      "      specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of\n",
      "      buoyant matter in him. But it is not so. For young whales, in the highest\n",
      "      health, and swelling with noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the\n",
      "      warm flush and May of life, with all their panting lard about them; even\n",

      "      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\n",
      "      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\n",
      "      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in\n",
      "      no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his\n",
      "      Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\n",

      "      after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale again\n",
      "      rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is obvious. Gases\n",

      "      this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not necessary,\n",
      "      hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale’s belly,\n",
      "      but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems\n",
      "      reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale’s mouth\n",
      "      would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\n",

      "      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\n",
      "      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,\n",
      "      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined\n",
      "      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live\n",
      "      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to\n",
      "      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human\n",
      "      being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the\n",
      "      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the\n",
      "      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,\n",
      "      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight\n",
      "      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n",
      "      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and\n",
      "      this is on the top of his head.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable\n",
      "      to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element,\n",
      "      which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to\n",
      "      the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I\n",
      "      may possibly use some superfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it\n",
      "      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,\n",
      "      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a\n",
      "      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.\n",
      "      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who\n",
      "      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the\n",
      "      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling\n",
      "      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between\n",
      "      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n",
      "      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when\n",
      "      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So\n",
      "      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a\n",
      "      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless\n",
      "      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n",
      "      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n",
      "      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and\n",
      "      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n",
      "      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as\n",
      "      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising\n",
      "      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time\n",
      "      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\n",
      "      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then\n",
      "      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over\n",
      "      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\n",
      "      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his\n",
      "      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,\n",
      "      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,\n",
      "      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\n",
      "      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\n",
      "      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\n",
      "      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\n",
      "      whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not\n",
      "      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a\n",

      "      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\n",

      "      his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two\n",
      "      elements, it could not be expected to have the power of smelling. But\n",
      "      owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water or whether it\n",
      "      be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this\n",
      "      head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",

      "      of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a\n",
      "      water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the\n",
      "      mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed\n",
      "      with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It\n",
      "      is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal;\n",
      "      but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water\n",
      "      through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would\n",
      "      seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm\n",
      "      Whale’s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if\n",
      "      he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your\n",
      "      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You\n",

      "      always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his\n",
      "      spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around\n",
      "      him. And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops\n",

      "      whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another\n",
      "      thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet\n",

      "      still driving on in the wake of the whales, at length they seemed abating\n",
      "      their speed; gradually the ship neared them; and the wind now dying away,\n",
      "      word was passed to spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by\n",
      "      some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of\n",
      "      the three keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their\n",

      "      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\n",
      "      several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\n",
      "      general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they\n",
      "      were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\n",
      "      irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say\n",
      "      he is gallied. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto\n",
      "      rapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout;\n",
      "      and like King Porus’ elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they\n",
      "      seemed going mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast\n",
      "      irregular circles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their\n",
      "      short thick spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic.\n",
      "      This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who,\n",
      "      completely paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged\n",
      "      dismantled ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of\n",
      "      simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could\n",
      "      not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional\n",
      "      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding\n",
      "      together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have\n",
      "      fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when\n",
      "      herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit, they will, at the\n",
      "      slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\n",
      "      trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\n",
      "      therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before\n",
      "      us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\n",
      "      infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet\n",
      "      it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\n",
      "      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\n",
      "      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\n",
      "      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,\n",
      "      Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray in\n",
      "      our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight for\n",
      "      the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the whale\n",
      "      struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and indeed\n",
      "      is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present one of the\n",
      "      more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift monster drags\n",
      "      you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect\n",
      "      life and only exist in a delirious throb.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\n",
      "      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\n",
      "      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the\n",
      "      crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a\n",

      "      that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time,\n",
      "      Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way\n",
      "      whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time to\n",
      "      make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty\n",
      "      was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the shouting\n",
      "      part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried one, to a great\n",
      "      dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface, and for an instant\n",
      "      threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail, there!” cried a second\n",
      "      to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly cooling himself\n",
      "      with his own fan-like extremity.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by\n",
      "      the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal\n",
      "      size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other’s grain\n",
      "      at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the\n",
      "      middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can\n",
      "      in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales\n",
      "      that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than\n",
      "      you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day\n",
      "      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you\n",
      "      cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be\n",
      "      afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these\n",
      "      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of\n",
      "      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales\n",
      "      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of\n",
      "      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and\n",
      "      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the\n",
      "      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in\n",
      "      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\n",
      "      boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea came\n",
      "      in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts\n",
      "      in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not\n",
      "      that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly diminished;\n",
      "      moreover, that as we went still further and further from the circumference\n",
      "      of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last\n",
      "      the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished;\n",
      "      then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we glided between\n",
      "      two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if from some mountain\n",
      "      torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here the storms in the\n",
      "      roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard but not felt. In\n",
      "      this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satin-like surface,\n",
      "      called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in\n",
      "      his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they\n",
      "      say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted\n",
      "      distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw\n",
      "      successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and\n",
      "      round, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder\n",
      "      to shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the\n",
      "      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density\n",
      "      of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed\n",
      "      axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.\n",
      "      We must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall\n",
      "      that had only admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of\n",
      "      the lake, we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the\n",

      "      At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be\n",
      "      deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\n",
      "      seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\n",
      "      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked\n",
      "      up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd had\n",
      "      hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping;\n",
      "      or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way innocent and\n",
      "      inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales—now\n",
      "      and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake—evinced\n",
      "      a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic\n",

      "      snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it\n",
      "      almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg\n",
      "      patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but\n",
      "      fearful of the consequences, for the time refrained from darting it.\n",

      "    \n",
      "      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\n",
      "      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in\n",

      "      have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth. He\n",

      "      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\n",
      "      enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire\n",
      "      the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening\n",
      "      distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the\n",

      "      the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run away with the\n",

      "      weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoon-line round his\n",
      "      tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose from his flesh. So that\n",
      "      tormented to madness, he was now churning through the water, violently\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\n",
      "      fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a\n",
      "      little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows\n",

      "      contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in\n",
      "      thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was departing. A low advancing hum\n",
      "      was soon heard; and then like to the tumultuous masses of block-ice when\n",
      "      the great river Hudson breaks up in Spring, the entire host of whales came\n",
      "      tumbling upon their inner centre, as if to pile themselves up in one\n",

      "      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an\n",
      "      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin\n",
      "      was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject.\n",
      "      For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise\n",
      "      origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned.\n",
      "      Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet\n",
      "      the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though at times found on\n",
      "      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris\n",
      "      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,\n",
      "      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n",
      "      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,\n",
      "      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,\n",
      "      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it\n",
      "      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s\n",

      "      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and,\n",
      "      temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\n",

      "    \n",
      "      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but\n",

      "      the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the\n",
      "      fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened,\n",
      "      in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The involuntary\n",
      "      consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the\n",

      "      his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in\n",
      "      it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale\n",
      "      started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor\n",
      "      Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged\n",

      "      its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed\n",
      "      interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face plainly looked,\n",
      "      Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute,\n",

      "    \n",
      "      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by\n",

      "      gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat,\n",

      "      would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don’t jump any more.”\n",
      "       Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow,\n",

      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\n",

      "      he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run,\n",
      "      Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s trunk. Alas!\n",

      "      Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was winged. In\n",
      "      three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between Pip and Stubb.\n",
      "      Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black\n",

      "    \n",
      "      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\n",

      "      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\n",

      "      ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in\n",
      "      length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull\n",
      "      and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain\n",
      "      back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a third of\n",
      "      its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his\n",
      "      vitals.\n",

      "      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\n",

      "      but a long, disconnected timber.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly\n",
      "      six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively\n",
      "      longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle\n",
      "      ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From that part, the\n",
      "      remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only spanned five feet\n",
      "      and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore a seemly\n",

      "      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the\n",
      "      whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the\n",
      "      Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish\n",
      "      which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the\n",
      "      invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen\n",
      "      feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight\n",
      "      feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living\n",
      "      magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked\n",
      "      spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in\n",
      "      flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the ample fins, I here\n",
